# Hotel_Roguelike
Horror-influenced 'roguelike' utilizing advanced lighting algorithm and procedural floormap generation. Play through the interactive story; try to figure out what's going on in order to escape the hotel. Ray-casting was used to implement lighting effects. Dijkstra's algorithm handles pathfinding for non-player characters. Procedurally-generated floors and rooms means exploration is always unsettling, albeit familar.
